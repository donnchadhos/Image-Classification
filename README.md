MNIST stand for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. 

Dataset:
The dataset set contains 60,000 square graysclae images that are 28 x 28 pixels each. The images are of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9. 

The task of this dataset is to classify the images into on of the 10 classes (e.g. 0-9).

This dataset is an introduction to deep learning and convolutional neural networks
